## TODO:
* Add route join table so I can parse routes and display more interesting paths
* Make nicer looking pins and lines
* Add ability for other people to create their own maps if interest is shown.

Airport data from: http://ourairports.com/data, http://www.wayforward.net/avdata/

Need to run: `RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rake assets:precompile` to get asset changes on production. Fixing this is on the list of TODOs
