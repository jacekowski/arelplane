Hello, Arel here from Arelplane. ðŸ‘‹ Thanks for joining, and welcome!

Arelplane is a community of pilots. Feel free to look around at other pilots' pages, and if you see something cool, let the pilot know by liking their map.

On a personal note, I'm a pilot working on Arelplane when on the ground. I'm always looking for ways to make Arelplane more helpful and fun, so if you have any ideas, send me a facebook message [http://m.me/arelplane] or reply to this email.

Thanks again!
