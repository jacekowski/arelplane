 // This is a manifest file that'll be compiled into application.css, which will include all the files
 // listed below.
 //
 // Any CSS and SCSS file within this directory, lib/assets/stylesheets, vendor/assets/stylesheets,
 // or any plugin's vendor/assets/stylesheets directory can be referenced here using a relative path.
 //
 // You're free to add application-wide styles to this file and they'll appear at the bottom of the
 // compiled file so the styles you add here take precedence over styles defined in any other CSS/SCSS
 // files in this directory. Styles in this file should be added after the last require_* statement.
 // It is generally better to create a new file per style scope.
 //
 // 16px == 1rem so 16px*0.0625 = 1rem
 //
 // Custom bootstrap variables must be set or imported *before* bootstrap.
